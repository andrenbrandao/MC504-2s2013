::The Sushi Bar Problem::

This problem was inspired by a problem proposed by Kenneth Reek [9].

Imagine a sushi bar with 5 seats. If you arrive while there is an empty seat, you can take
a seat immediately. But if you arrive when all 5 seats are full, that means that
all of them are dining together, and you will have to wait for the entire party
to leave before you sit down.
